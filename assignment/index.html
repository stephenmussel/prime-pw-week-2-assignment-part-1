    <p>Line 88: My logic here is to create a variable (mostPets) but not assign anything to it until we compare two variables and find out which is the highest value. Then we assign the highest value to mostPets. Is this a correct method based on my code?</p>
    <p>Line 102: When I put default here, output is 2. But when I have a case 2 here, output is 3 which I beleive is the correct output. Why is that? Is that just the proper syntax and you need at least 2 cases to run a switch statement?</p>
